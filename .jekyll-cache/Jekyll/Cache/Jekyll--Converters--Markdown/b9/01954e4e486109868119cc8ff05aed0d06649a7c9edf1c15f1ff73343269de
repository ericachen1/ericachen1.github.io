<p>The following is a side project I worked on during Fall of 2020. The project consists of four components. The mirror was purchased from Target at the Discount Section. I collected empty toilet paper rolls from home to create the surrounding floral pattern of the mirror.</p>

<p>The breadboard, wires, plug-in stereo and ultrasonic sensor are were all borrowed materials. I had not been familiar with Arduino, so I taught myself the syntax of C++.</p>

<p>When a user is close enough to the mirror, this will trigger the censor to activate consequently outputting a customizable melody through the speaker.</p>

The upper red wires on the left side of the Arduino UNO (smaller board) connect to the ultrasonic sensor on the breadboard (longer white).</p>

<p>The mirror has a floral petal design surrounding the perimeter of the mirror. There is enough space between the crevices to insert the ultrasonic sensor and hide the base of the breadboard.</p>

<p>I used a public source to find a Pink Panther tune to output.</p>
