<p> I'm a 4th-year undergrad studying Computer Science and Statistics at Barnard College of Columbia University based in New York City. </p>
<p> I have experience in computer vision research, software engineering internships, part-time Election Day translator and volunteer at Elmhurst Hospital. </p>
<p> When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading up on environmental sustainability efforts in urban design, brainstorming start up ideas with friends or scrapbooking movie tickets and polaroid photos. </p>
<p> In my free time, I also enjoy sharing my latest <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ericraftss/" target="_blank">Do-It-Yourself project</a> on Instagram while building a community that allows me to share her passion of sustainability. </p>
