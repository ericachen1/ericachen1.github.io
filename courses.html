<p><strong>Summary</strong> - COMS W3134 introduces fundamental ways of algorithmic problem solving by organizing and processing information efficiently. The course covers basic data types and structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps, and graphs) as well as programming techniques and algorithms that operate on them (sorting, searching, hashing, finding shortests paths,...). We will examine implementations of data structures and algorithms in Java. The course also covers the rudiments of analyzing space and time requirements of algorithms.</p>

<h5>STAT 4203</h5>
<p>Probability Theory (3)</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> - Develops critical thinking and data analysis skills for regression analysis in science and policy settings. Simple and multiple linear regression, non-linear and logistic models, random-effects models. Implementation in a statistical package. Emphasis on real-world examples and on planning, proposing, implementing, and reporting.</p>

<h5>ORCA 2500</h5>
<p>Foundations of Data Science (3)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/yi-zhang">Prof. Yi Zhang</a></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> - Designed to provide an introduction to data science for sophomore SEAS majors. Combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world applications. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? Teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming, statistical inference, and machine learning, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets such as economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. At least one project will address a problem relevant to New York City.</p>

<h5>MUSI 2023</h5>
<p>Beethoven (3)</p>
<p>Prof. Elaine Sisman</a></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> - What made Beethoven such a game-changer? Influenced by Mozart but frustrated by Haydn's late successes, his career spanned Enlightenment, Revolution, and Romanticism, and his final decade overlapped the age of Rossini and Schubert. We will examine Beethoven's music and impact in a volatile era of political and philosophical transformations. No score-reading required.</p>

<h5>SPAN 1101</h5>
<p>Elementary Spanish I (3)</p>
<p>Prof. Lee Abraham</a></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> - An introduction to Spanish communicative competence, with stress on basic oral interaction, reading, witting, and cultural knowledge. Principal objectives are to understand and produce commonly used sentences to satisfy immediate needs; ask and answer questions about personal details such as where we live, people we know and things we have; interact in a simple manner with people who speak clearly, slowly and are ready to cooperate; and understand simple and short written and audiovisual texts in Spanish</p>

<h2>Spring 2021</h2>
