## Background 
The following is a project I worked on during Spring 2022 after having completed two semesters of college Spanish. The prompt was to create written summaries and record audioguides for five art displays in NYC by artists from one Spanish speaking country of our choice.

## React
The React website incorporates components that takes in user input (title, location, image URL, type, description, year, style) to display on the site.
